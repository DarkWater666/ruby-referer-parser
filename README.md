    gem 'referer-parser'

```ruby
require 'referer-parser'

p = RefererParser::Parser.new('http://www.google.com/search?q=gateway+oracle+cards+denise+linn&hl=en&client=safari')

puts p.known?  				 # =>  true
puts p.referer 				 # => 'Google'
puts p.search_parameter      # => 'q'			
puts p.search_term           # => 'gateway oracle cards denise linn'
