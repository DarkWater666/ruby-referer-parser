# Attlib Ruby library

This is the Ruby implementation of [Attlib] [attlib], the library for extracting search marketing attribution data from referrer URLs.

The implementation uses the shared 'database' of search engines found in [`search_engines.yml`] [search-engines-yml].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'attlib'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install attlib

## Usage

Use Attlib like this:

	require 'attlib'

	new_referrer = Referrer.new('http://www.google.com/search?q=gateway+oracle+cards+denise+linn&hl=en&client=safari&tbo=d&biw=768&bih=900&source=lnms&tbm=isch&ei=t9fTT_TFEYb28gTtg9HZAw&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&cd=2&sqi=2&ved=0CEUQ_AUoAQ') # Initialise the new Referrer object with the referrer URL to be parsed

	new_referrer.is_search_engine? 	# True
	new_referrer.search_engine 		# 'Google'
	new_referrer.keywords 			# 'gateway oracle cards denise linn'
