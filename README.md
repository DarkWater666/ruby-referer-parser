# referer-parser Ruby library

This is the Ruby implementation of [referer-parser] [referer-parser], the library for extracting search marketing data from referer _(sic)_ URLs.

The implementation uses the shared 'database' of known referers found in [`referers.yml`] [referers-yml].

**Currently the Ruby library only extracts search engine referers - it needs updating with the additional functionality now found in the Java/Scala version.**

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'referer-parser'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install referer-parser

## Usage

Use referer-parser like this:

```ruby
require 'referer-parser'

referer_url = 'http://www.google.com/search?q=gateway+oracle+cards+denise+linn&hl=en&client=safari'

r = RefererParser::Referer.new(referer_url)

puts r.known?                # =>  true
puts r.referer               # => 'Google'
puts r.search_parameter      # => 'q'     
puts r.search_term           # => 'gateway oracle cards denise linn'
puts r.uri.host              # => 'www.google.com'
```
